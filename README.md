The aim of this project is to recreate the Advance Wars Clone. Done in vb.net by myself. For Contact Inforamtion see the wiki page

The project is seperated in three parts.
* The core engine written in C++ using oxygine as a render and input engine and qt as a interpreter, language support etc. framework
* The ressource folder containing the javascript default data and images and sounds or music
* The mod folder containing mods for the coreengine
